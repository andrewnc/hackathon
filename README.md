# Mathify

This was our 1st place project we did for the annual hackathon. It uses bezier curves to interpolate user inputed text, then graphs the polynomials, and displays the mathematical equations of the inputed text. 

Essentially, you can 'mathify' any words you'd like. 

Written in Django with Numpy as a requirement. It's easy to install and run the site. We're working on getting it perminately hosted somewhere, but for now you'd have to run it yourself.
